KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE 
Master Node: 
> Api server 
> Distribute Database(etcd)
> Scheduler (Kube Scheduler)
> Controller Manager (Kube-controller-manager)

etcd --- stores the configurations for kubernetes (pods, services)etc and generate cluster state 
Api server --- this is how kubctl and gke/aws eks/ Aks communicate with the kubenetes cluster 
scheduler is responsibe for scheduling pods on appropriate nodes 
controller manager, manages the overall state of the cluster. Keeps controll of the desired state and changes of the cluster 


WORKER NOEDS 
> Node agent (kubelet) // monitors the condition of the node and reports to the master node. (e.g when a pod is down or created )
> Networking component(Kube-proxy)  // creates network e.g exposign services around nodes and pods 
> Container runtime (CRI-docer, rkt or any oci(open container interface)) // provides an environment for containers to run 


When application goes down, the master node keeps working. 
we might not be able to make changes to them, but accessing the url still gives response from the worker nodes 


>kubectl get componentstatuses // shows master nodes components statuses 
// worker nodes can also just be called the 'nodes'

REGIONS AND ZONES 
We need regions for availablility(Distribute app in different regions), latency(app is closer to user) and Legal requirements (countries might not want citizen's data to be stored outside the country )
Zones are physically isolated data centers within a region. 


So... for each region(provides accross the globe), we have multiple zones(physical data centers in the region)

// TO VIEW HISTORY OF KUBCTL COMMANDS 
> kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world-rest-api 
> kubctl set image deployment hello-world-rest-api hello-world-rest-api=in28min/hello-world-rest-api:0.0.3.RELEASE --record=true 


//now kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world-rest-api // shows change cause now 
> kubectl undo deployment hello-world-rest-api --to-revision=1   // to undo a deployment 
> kubectl rollout deployment hello-world-rest-api pause // pause deployment 
> kubectl get pods 
> kubctl log <pod_id>
> kubctl log -f <pod_id>

>kubectl get deployment hello-world-rest-api -o yaml // shows status of pods in deployment in yaml 
> kubectl get deployment hello-world-rest-api -o yaml > deployment.yaml 
> kubectl get service hello-world-rest-api -o yaml > service.yaml 
// we can now edit config and re-create 
> kubectl apply -f deployment.yml 


// we can now copy the service and paste below in the deployment file (under ---[three hyphens])

// we can delete a deployment/service/replicaset using their central label 
>kubctl get all -o wide // to view resources and labels 
> kubctl delete all -l app=hello-world-rest-api(label)


// deploying from a file 
> kubctl apply -f deployment.yaml 
> kubctl get all // get resources ... now see deployment and service created 
> kubectl get svc --watch 
> watch curl <site_url> 
> kubectl diff -f deployment.yaml // see difference betwwen file and upstream resources 

// AN ENV OF PORTS IS CREATED AT DEPLOYMENT TIME 
> CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST 
// but this can be configured manually using env: property in the deployment 
/ Service discovery points domains(of pods/deployment) running on the service

> so from currentcy conversion, we can access currency exchange domain using: process.ENV.CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST 
// kubernetes adds hypens(-) , SERVICE_HOST and capitaliztion to get the dns env automatically from each deployment 
// this constitues service descovery where a new service automatically knows the internal details (e.g dns)  of other services using exposed as environment variables 


MICROSERVICE CONTAINARIZATION 
centralized ocnfiguration using configMaps 

1. create configMap file 
2. kubectl apply -f {config_map-file.yaml}   // creates the configmap file 
3. kubectl get configMaps  
4. kubectl describe configmap {configmap_name}

with microservice, using a different load balancer for each deployment can be expensive. 
to fix this, we use an ingress to create a load balancer for these different deployments internally and expose them using service 

// we change the 'type' from nodebalancer services to 'NodePort'
This makes the services internal with no external ips 
Then we expose an external Ip using ingress
// see ingress file. 
// creation of ingress takes a long time... say 15-20 mins
